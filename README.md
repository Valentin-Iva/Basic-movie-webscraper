# Basic-movie-webscraper
This is a simple app coded in the python Flask web micro-framework. It parses HTML from the website springfieldspringfield.co.uk to generate a random movie quote.
I made this app to practice my skills in python automation and to learn to use the Flask library in Python to make backend for future web apps i may build.
